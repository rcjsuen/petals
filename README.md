# Petals

**Petals** is a card tracker for the _Hanabi_ card game.
It is built with Ionic.
Petals can be accessed online [here](https://rcjsuen.github.io/petals/).

## Development Instructions

If you wish to build and compile Petals, you must first install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you have not already done so.
After you have installed Node.js, you will need to install the `ionic` CLI tool.

```
npm install --global ionic
```

Once you have installed the `ionic` CLI, you can clone this repository with Git and then run the following commands:

```
npm install
ionic serve
```

You can now open `http://localhost:8100/ionic-lab` in a browser and start developing Petals locally on your computer.
If you are interested in testing Petals on your device, we recommend using [Ionic DevApp](https://ionicframework.com/docs/pro/devapp/) to get instant feedback of your changes with live reload.
